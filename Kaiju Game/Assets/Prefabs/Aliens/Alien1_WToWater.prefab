  name: Specimen 7
  hintBox1: Placing itself in the center of the city, the specimen seems to taunt
    the Kaiju into moving closer inland.
  hintBox2: After a very once sided battle the specimen looked as though to consider
    retreat even though it was on the cusp of a victory all because of some looming
    dark clouds.
  hintBox3: Rain started to pour down in the middle of the battle, this was the only
    time the specimen showed any form of pain as it screeched in agony at the raindrops.
